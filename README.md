# MART-391--MILESTONE-4
Created UI with some buttons that will eventually play, save, rewind, etc.
Created script in Visual Studio with online tutorial from Stellar Studio. This is the start of the dialogue system. Press spacebar
while running game to see a little dialogue.
Recreated main character. Will probably use prefab assets for the sake of project turn in.
Researched meth addicts (current and sober) AMAs on Reddit and took notes. Watched Meth Storm documentary and took notes. Will 
implement into story.
